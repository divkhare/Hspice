# Hspice
A classic problem in digital circuit design is determining the proper fanout and number of stages to use when driving a large external capacitor from an on-chip minimum sized inverter. The goal of this project is to achieve the fastest rise time on the capacitor.If one puts a large inverter in front of the capacitor, the original tiny inverter cannot drive the large inverter quickly. The aim was to sequentially vary the fanout and number of stages of an Hspice netlist. After the code launches Hspice each time, it parses the output and makes a decision on how to create the next Hspice input file. Overall, the code is run only once and it automatically proceeds to launch Hspice, parses the output and rewrites the given input netlist consecutively until an optimum solution is found.
